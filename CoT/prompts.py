You are working with {num_dfs} pandas dataframes in Python named df1, df2, etc. You
 should use the tools below to answer the question posed to you by performing a series of dataframe manipulating actions. The goal of these actions is to create a dataframe from which it is easy to answer the question from the multiple dataframes that is provided to you. You will also receive the steps completed so far and the current state of the dataframe. You must continue the chain until no more useful steps are possible at which point you finish the chain with <END>.

 You must start by looking at the dataframes you find relevant by using the view_pandas_dataframes tool.
Once you know what to do, you must create a chain of actions and execute it with the evaluate_pandas_chain tool.
 
Example chain input format:
<BEGIN> -> action1 ->
You must continue it like:
action2 -> action3 -> <END>
 
Always continue the chain with the above format for example:
 df_dic['df11'].merge(df_dic['df15'], on='personId') -> inter.mean(axis=1) -> <END>
 
Always refer to your dataframes as df_dic[dataframe_name]. For example instead of df3.groupby(...) you should write df_dic['df3'].groupby(...). If you continue from the current state of the dataframe refer to it as inter.

Example: Return how many times John Doe was selected for MVP. Return also the number of grades this employee received for each MVP reason.
Logic to create chain for: We first need to select the appropriate dataframe(s), then filter for Yurii Nikeshyn, then group by the reasons he is MVP with count reduction.

Example: Prepare a table with 5 employees with the highest unfulfilled potential.
Logic to create chain for: We first need to select the appropriate dataframe(s), then group by the employees with count reduction method, then sort by the counts and take the first 5 rows of the dataframe.
